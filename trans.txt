Whilst tobacco is primarily smoked worldwide, there are a number of specific
populations whose tobacco habits include the use of either snuff (finely ground
or cut tobacco leaves) or chewing tobacco (which comprises loose leaf pro-
ducts). Estimates suggest that the risk of oral cancer is nearly 3.5 times higher in
smokers compared with non-smokers, with bidi smoking in India (which uses
flaked tobacco rolled in a temburni leaf) being a particularly dangerous
habit [13,14].
Tobacco products contain more than 70 known carcinogens, most impor-
tantly nitrosamines and polycyclic hydrocarbons such as benzo(a)pyrene.
Whilst the latter are the most important carcinogenic agents in cigarette smoke,
it is the nitrosamines that appear to cause most damage in unburnt tobacco [14].
A failure to metabolise and detoxify these carcinogens has been shown to lead to
the adduction of active carcinogens to oral keratinocyte DNA [13].
Boyle et al. have recently reported on a number of changes observed in the
buccal mucosa of smokers, including the overexpression of multiple genes
involved in carcinogen metabolism, increased prostaglandin levels and a rise
in Langerhans cells. Whilst such detailed genetic analyses become increasingly
complex, the recognition of increased defensive action against carcinogens
and a possible smoking-related change in mucosal immune function clearly
highlight the increased risk of carcinogenesis in the oral mucosa of
smokers [15].
